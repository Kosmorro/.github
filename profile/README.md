This is the official GitHub organization for [Kosmorro](https://kosmorro.space), a software design to help amateur astronomers to prepare their observation nights.

## Repositories

Kosmorro's source code is organized in two repositories:

- **[`kosmorro`](https://github.com/Kosmorro/kosmorro)**: the command line application
- **[`lib`](https://github.com/Kosmorro/lib)**: the Kosmorrolib library, that makes all the calculations

These repositories also contain useful resources:

- **[`libdoc`](https://github.com/Kosmorro/libdoc)**: the documentation of the Kosmorrolib library
- **[`logos`](https://github.com/Kosmorro/logos)**: the official logos of Kosmorro

## Getting support

If you need help to use either Kosmorro or the Kosmorrolib, check [the support page](https://kosmorro.space/support/) to find the one that best suits for you.
